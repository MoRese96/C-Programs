Project Summary
The Item Frequency Tracker is a C++ program that reads an input file containing a list of items, counts their occurrences, and provides a menu-driven interface to look up item frequencies, display a list, print a histogram, and save the data to a file. It solves the problem of efficiently analyzing item frequency in datasets while ensuring user-friendly interaction. The strengths displayed in the code are clear class structure, robust file handling, user input validation, and modular code design. Improvements needed for this list would be optimizing file handling, using unordered_map for efficiency, improving exception handling, and enhance input validation. Key challenges included handling invalid input, designing a structured menu system, and ensuring proper file operations. Solutions involved using cin.clear(), structured loops, and careful error handling. The project reinforced OOP principles, data structures (maps), file I/O handling, input validation, and debugging skills, making it applicable to data processing and software design. The program is well-structured, modular, and documented, with clear variable names, proper indentation, and error handling to ensure adaptability for future enhancements.
